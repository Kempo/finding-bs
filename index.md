## What is bullshit?
_**Bullshit, in my project definition, is language, statistical figures, data graphics, and other forms of presentation intended to persuade by impressing and overwhelming a reader or listener, with a blatant disregard for truth and logical coherence**._

### How did I gather this data?

Every day for a week, I tried to keep my eyes peeled bullshit I produced or was exposed to. My goal was to be bullshit neutral in my day-to-day life. But, sadly, as you can see below, I was mass producer of bullshit.
