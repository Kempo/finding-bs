## What is bullshit?
_**Bullshit, in my project definition, is language, statistical figures, data graphics, and other forms of presentation intended to persuade by impressing and overwhelming a reader or listener, with a blatant disregard for truth and logical coherence**._

### How did I gather this data?

Every day for a week, I tried to keep my eyes peeled bullshit I produced or was exposed. Once observed, I'd quickly go on my phone for a quick minute and type my observations on a Google Sheets document. My goal was to be bullshit neutral in my day-to-day life: producing just as much bullshit that I encountered. According to this data set, I seemingly produced less bullshit than other sources (online or in the news), but I think there's always room for improvement.

### Observations

1. My original prediction that my roommate would have the smallest amount of bullshit emitted was correct. After all, I had a definite conclusion before starting that project that I emitted tons more bullshit than him on daily basis. Mostly due to the fact that I often speak before actually thinking through what I'm going to say. 

2. Bullshit I found online and not from a specific news source often was the most controversial and most common misinformation that I encountered. Viral posts on Facebook or Twitter were prevalent all over my "feeds". These BS creators purposely made emotionally convincing posts (from _"real life experiences"_, or by _"citing scientists"_) that seemed credible and factual, but ultimately they were either false or true but warped in a way to make it seem like new information.

- Thousands of Facebook users have liked and commented while tens of thousands have shared this photo depicting an airport in Florida flooding due to Hurricane Michael. What the majority of these Facebook users realize is that this picture was actually a digitally edited photo by artist Nikolay Lamm posted on [Climate Central](http://www.climatecentral.org/news/coastal-us-airports-face-increasing-threat-from-sea-level-rise-16126) in 2013 with the caption:
